# Hi~ I'm vito.
# Today, I'm gonna introduce how to use git with vscode.
# 1. Install git to your PC (not portable version if you want to use vscode)
# 2. Click it, and it will link to your github, requesting login.
# 3. In your vscode terminal, enter the following commands after you have checked your repository (ex. this work folder):
#   3-1. git init
#   3-2. git add .
#   3-3. git commit -m "your commit"
#   3-4. git remote add origin https://github.com/vito-hsu/python_with_git.git
#   3-5. git push origin master
# Let's try it
# I just run the above commands again, and you can see the .py file has changed like this.
# Let's try it again.
